# gaffyhoaresbank-extra

This Project includes

Dagger2 for Dependency Injection
Code is in Kotlin
MVVM architecture for Better Testability
Retrofit for Network API Calls
RxJava2 for Managing tasks on different threads
Kotlin coroutines 

Possible Improvements with increased time and scope:

Creating reusable fragment and possibly navigation drawer
Using fragments to implement Master-Detail Flow
Caching search terms to show a recently searched list
Using architecture components to make the app lifecycle aware
Cache db i.e. in real for search saves
